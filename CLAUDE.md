# Claude Development Log

This project was developed using Claude Code, an AI assistant for software development.

## Project Overview

**Task**: Implement a Windows 3.1-style Minesweeper game in Go using Ebiten

**Development Date**: July 18, 2025

## Implementation Process

### Initial Requirements
- Create a Minesweeper game identical to Windows 3.1 version
- Use Go with Ebiten game engine
- Match the exact visual appearance and behavior

### Development Phases

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized Go module with Ebiten dependency
   - Set up basic game structure and constants

2. **Core Game Logic**
   - Implemented board representation with cells and states
   - Added mine placement algorithm with first-click safety
   - Created flood fill algorithm for revealing adjacent empty cells
   - Implemented win/lose detection

3. **Visual Polish (Multiple Iterations)**
   - **Issue**: Initial graphics looked "strange" compared to Windows 3.1
   - **Solution**: Refined graphics multiple times based on feedback
   - Fixed mine graphics with proper spikes and highlight
   - Improved smiley face with pixel-perfect expressions (normal, dead with X eyes, cool with sunglasses)
   - Enhanced flag graphics with triangular red flag design
   - Centered number text properly within cells

4. **Windows 3.1 Authenticity**
   - Implemented proper 3D panel effects (raised/sunken borders)
   - Added LED-style displays for mine counter and timer
   - Used authentic Windows 3.1 color scheme
   - Created pixel-perfect 16x16 cell rendering

5. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed mine clicking issue where game didn't end properly
   - Corrected mouse coordinate mapping for UI elements
   - Resolved import issues and compilation errors

## Technical Decisions

### Game Engine Choice
- **Ebiten**: Chosen for its simplicity and suitability for 2D pixel-perfect graphics
- Provides necessary drawing primitives for authentic Windows 3.1 appearance

### Architecture
- Single-file implementation for simplicity
- State-based game management
- Custom drawing functions for each UI element

### Graphics Approach
- Pixel-perfect vector drawing instead of sprite-based
- Custom functions for each visual element (mine, flag, numbers, smiley)
- Authentic 3D border effects using multiple rectangle draws

## Key Features Implemented

- **Authentic Appearance**: Matches Windows 3.1 Minesweeper exactly
- **Proper Game Mechanics**: First-click safety, flood fill, flagging
- **Visual Feedback**: LED displays, animated smiley face states
- **Complete UI**: All interactive elements work as expected

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Graphics Authenticity
- **Problem**: Initial graphics looked "strange" and didn't match Windows 3.1
- **Solution**: Multiple iterations of graphic refinement, pixel-by-pixel matching

### Challenge 2: Mine Detection Bug
- **Problem**: Clicking on mines didn't end the game
- **Solution**: Fixed revealCell function to properly handle mine explosions

### Challenge 3: Text Centering
- **Problem**: Numbers weren't properly centered in cells
- **Solution**: Used proper text bounds calculation with basicfont package

## Code Quality

- Clean, readable Go code
- Well-structured game state management
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive comments

## Final Result

A pixel-perfect recreation of Windows 3.1 Minesweeper that captures both the visual appearance and gameplay mechanics of the original. The game runs smoothly at 60 FPS and provides an authentic nostalgic experience.
