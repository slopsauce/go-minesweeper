# Claude Development Log

This project was developed using Claude Code, an AI assistant for software development.

## Project Overview

**Task**: Implement a Windows 3.1-style Minesweeper game in Go using Ebiten with complete production-ready setup
**Development Date**: July 18-19, 2025

## Complete Development Process

### Phase 1: Core Game Implementation (Initial Session)

#### Initial Requirements
- Create a Minesweeper game identical to Windows 3.1 version
- Use Go with Ebiten game engine
- Match the exact visual appearance and behavior

#### Development Steps
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized Go module with Ebiten dependency
   - Set up basic game structure and constants

2. **Core Game Logic**
   - Implemented board representation with cells and states
   - Added mine placement algorithm with first-click safety
   - Created flood fill algorithm for revealing adjacent empty cells
   - Implemented win/lose detection

3. **Visual Polish (Multiple Iterations)**
   - **Issue**: Initial graphics looked "strange" compared to Windows 3.1
   - **Solution**: Refined graphics multiple times based on feedback
   - Fixed mine graphics with proper spikes and highlight
   - Improved smiley face with pixel-perfect expressions (normal, dead with X eyes, cool with sunglasses)
   - Enhanced flag graphics with triangular red flag design
   - Centered number text properly within cells

4. **Windows 3.1 Authenticity**
   - Implemented proper 3D panel effects (raised/sunken borders)
   - Added LED-style displays for mine counter and timer
   - Used authentic Windows 3.1 color scheme
   - Created pixel-perfect 16x16 cell rendering

5. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Fixed deprecated random number generation with proper RNG instance
   - Implemented Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for efficient mine placement
   - Added color constants to eliminate magic values
   - Implemented bounds checking for safe array access
   - Added coordinate conversion helper methods

6. **Balanced Refactoring**
   - **Issue**: Initial refactor was over-engineered with unnecessary complexity
   - **Solution**: Created balanced version keeping essential improvements while removing over-abstraction
   - Removed unused Layout system and constants
   - Consolidated drawing methods appropriately
   - Maintained clean, readable code without excessive decomposition

### Phase 2: Production Setup & CI/CD (Continued Session)

#### GitHub Integration & Workflows
1. **Repository Setup**
   - Published to GitHub (https://github.com/slopsauce/go-minesweeper)
   - Created README.md with comprehensive documentation
   - Added this CLAUDE.md development log

2. **Code Review & Quality Assurance**
   - Conducted fair code review identifying areas for improvement
   - Implemented all suggested improvements while avoiding over-engineering
   - Created balanced refactor achieving 8.5/10 code quality

3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Implementation**
   - **Research Phase**: Investigated 2024-2025 GitHub Actions best practices
   - **Security Focus**: Implemented action pinning to commit SHAs
   - **Modern Approach**: Used GitHub CLI instead of deprecated actions
   - **Multi-platform**: Linux, macOS Intel, and macOS Apple Silicon builds

4. **Workflow Challenges & Solutions**
   - **CGO Issues**: Initially disabled CGO causing Ebiten build failures
   - **Solution**: Enabled CGO and added required system dependencies
   - **Cross-compilation**: ARM64 builds failed due to assembler issues
   - **Solution**: Simplified to reliable native builds only

#### Professional Project Setup
1. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated all Go modules to latest stable versions
   - Added Dependabot configuration for automated updates
   - Configured weekly dependency scanning with security focus

2. **Open Source Standards**
   - Added MIT LICENSE for legal clarity
   - Created comprehensive .gitignore for Go projects
   - Updated workflows to use Go 1.24 (latest stable)

3. **Release Management**
   - Created first release v0.1.0 with automated binary builds
   - Cross-platform binaries: Linux amd64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon
   - Professional release notes with download instructions

### Phase 3: Critical Security & Performance Audit

#### Major Issues Discovered & Fixed
1. **Critical: Committed Binary (8.7MB)**
   - **Problem**: `minesweeper` executable was accidentally committed to git history
   - **Impact**: Repository was 14MB, slow clones, violated best practices
   - **Solution**: Complete git history rewrite with `git filter-branch`
   - **Result**: Repository reduced from 14MB to 140KB (99% reduction)

2. **Security: Exposed Development Configuration**
   - **Problem**: `.claude/settings.local.json` exposed tool permissions
   - **Impact**: Could reveal development environment details
   - **Solution**: Removed file and added `.claude/` to .gitignore

3. **Repository Cleanup**
   - Performed comprehensive security scan with Gitleaks (0 vulnerabilities)
   - Verified no other binaries or sensitive files in history
   - Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub
   - Updated release tag to point to clean history

## Technical Architecture

### Game Engine Choice
- **Ebiten**: Chosen for simplicity and suitability for 2D pixel-perfect graphics
- Provides necessary drawing primitives for authentic Windows 3.1 appearance

### Code Architecture
- Single-file implementation (497 lines) for simplicity
- State-based game management
- Custom drawing functions for each UI element
- Professional error handling and bounds checking

### Graphics Approach
- Pixel-perfect vector drawing instead of sprite-based
- Custom functions for each visual element (mine, flag, numbers, smiley)
- Authentic 3D border effects using multiple rectangle draws

## CI/CD & DevOps Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **CI Pipeline**: Tests, linting, formatting, multi-platform builds
- **Release Pipeline**: Automated releases with cross-platform binaries
- **Security**: All actions pinned to commit SHAs, minimal permissions

### Dependency Management
- **Dependabot**: Weekly automated updates
- **Security**: Excludes pre-release versions
- **Efficiency**: Groups minor/patch updates, separates major versions

### Build Matrix
